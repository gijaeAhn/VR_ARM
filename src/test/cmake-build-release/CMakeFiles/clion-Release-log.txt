CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindZeroMQ.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ZeroMQ", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ZeroMQ" with any
  of the following names:

    ZeroMQConfig.cmake
    zeromq-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ZeroMQ" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ZeroMQ_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ZeroMQ"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
